Files included:
1) GUI.java
2) WebApp.java
3) Readme

To begin with, 'GUI.java' should be implemented. This will generate a body for the Application. Then we add components to the Application in 'WebApp.java'.
The Application starts by asking the name of the city or the zip code. Then, it asks for the measurement in which the temperature should be displayed. 
The various units are Celcius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin. Accordingly, we get the information in the text area of the application. The information provided 
includes the current condition at that place, its longitude and latitude and the current temperature, minimum temperature and maximum temperature. Also, 
we can see the map of the region for which the weather information is being displayed.
